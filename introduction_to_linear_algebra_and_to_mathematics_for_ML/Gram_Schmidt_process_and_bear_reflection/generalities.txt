Let's have a set of vectors V[v1,v2,vn], and they span the space. Let's assume the linear independence. (Remember that if they aren't independent, then their determinant will be zero)

The Gram-Schmidt process helps us contruct an orthonormal space
Let's take V1
e1=v1/|v1| #it's a  normalized of v1:
v2=v2 dot e1
