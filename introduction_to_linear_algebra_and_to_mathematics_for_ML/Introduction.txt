The first thing we have to is to understand 
vectors.

takigs as an example the classical histogram of
height (which has a normal distribution).
How do we fit this histogram into an equation?
It can be explain with 2 parameters:
Mu and sigma.
But how do we fit a normal distribution so as
it fits our data? (only changing the 2 parameters)
(missmatching the distribution of our data can understimate 
or overstimate values in our data)

We can plot the values of Mu vs Sigma where (0,0)
is the perfect fitting to our data.
for example a point (1,1) means that we believe that
they're taller than they really are (overestimating)
and that the variance is bigger than it really is.
(x=Mu, y=Sigma).

Once we have defined the function that describes our
data, we can asses its "goodness" or "badness"
by changing the parameters and see how the function
changes.

A model is only considered good if it fits the measured data well.
some specific values for the parameters will be better than others.
we need a way to quantify how good a model is.
one way of doing this is to calculate the residuals, which is
the difference between the measured data and the modelled prediction.
for each histogram bin.

the performance of a model can be quantified in a single number.
One measure we can use is the sum of the squared residuals. SSR
Here we take all the residuals (the difference between the measured and the predicted data), square them and add them up.
In the language of vectors it can be written as:
SSR = (y - y_hat)^2
where y is the measured data and y_hat is the predicted data.
