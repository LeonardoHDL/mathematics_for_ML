#Introduction: Einstein summation convention and the symmetry 
of the dot product

There's other way to write matrix transformations down, it's called the einstein Summation Convention. This convention writed down what the actual operations are on the elements of a matrix. Also lets us ldeal with no square matrices.

Regular convention:
A=
a11 a12 a1n...
a21 a22 ...
an1 an2 ...

B=
b11 b12 b1n
b21 b22 b2n
bn1 bn2 bnn

(ab)23= a21b13+a22b23+a2n+bn3

Different than the Einstein Summation that it's:
Cik=aijbjk
This allows us to multiply matrices with different shapes
Which in this case woul be J
So as long as the matrices have the same number of entries in J we can multiply them

Why are there similarities between matrix transformation and dot product?
Let's suppose a vector U[u1,u2]
In axis vectors E^[1 0;0 1]

If we project U onto E1 and E1 onto U, we get a dot where the projections crosses.
