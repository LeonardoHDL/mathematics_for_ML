###Introduction to Matrices
matrices are objects that let us solve simultaneous equations. They are also used in many other areas of mathematics. 
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. The numbers in the matrix are called its entries or its elements. 
The horizontal and vertical lines of entries in a matrix are called rows and columns, respectively. 
The size of a matrix is given in its number of rows and its number of columns.
 For example, the matrix below has size 2 Ã— 3 (read "two by three"), because it has two rows and three columns.
for example:
2a+3b=8
10a+1b=13
can be written as:
#notice that 2,3;10,1 is the first 2x2 matrix, then multiplied by 2x1 vector
and the solution is a vector of 2x1
[2 3] [a] = [8]
[10 1] [b] = [13]
then the multiplication will look like a matrix of simultaneous equations.
An equation system is a function that operates on input vectors
and gives us other output vectors. the set of simultaneous equations
is asking in fact what vector do I need to produce a specific output vector. (8,13)
and the vectors that we need is (a b)

Linear algebra is a mathematical system for manipulating of the space that is described by vectors

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### How matrices transform space
Now we'll look at different types of matrices and what they do to space. 
And what happens if we apply one matrix transformation and then another, which is termed composition. 
Now because we could make any vector out of a vector sum of the scaled versions of e1 hat and e2 hat. 
Then what that means is the result of the transformation is just going to be some sum of the transform 
vectors, which I'm calling e1 hat and e2 hat. This is a bit hard to see but what it means is that the 
grid lines of our space stay parallel and evenly spaced. They might be stretched or sheared, 
but the origin stays where it is and there isn't any curviness to the space, it doesn't get warped.

So that is if I write down the matrix as capital A and the vector its transforming is r, 
whatever it was. a b in our apples and bananas problem. And that gives me some altered version.
We said it was 8 13 before, but I'm going to call it r transformed or r prime. 
Then we can look at what happens when I do algebra with it. So if I multiply r by some number, 
just a number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
###types of matrix transformations
A matrix is just compose of the basis vectors of the space.
Identity Matrix=[1 0;0 1][x y]=[x y] and leaves the space as it was.
Scaling Matrix=[2 0;0 2][x y]=[2x 2y] and stretches the space by 2.
a fraction will shrink the space.
What happens is I have a matrix that has a negative number in it.
for example:
A=[-1 0;0 2][x y]=[-x 2y] and flips the space.
and for example:
A=[1 0;0 -1][x y]=[x -y] and flips the space.(It's called an inversion)

##matrix multiplication
It's to note that A1 multpilied by A2 it's not the same than A2 multplied by A1. It has no conmutative
propertie. We must remember that multiplying a matrix for another is like switching the space.
We can rotate, mirror and sheer our space when multplying by matrices

##mirrors
A= -1 0; 0 1 flips the x axis (vertical mirror)
A= 1 0 ; 0 -1 flips the y axis (horizontal mirro)

##shears
what if we want to transform 1 0;0 1 to 1 0;1 1 (that creates instead of a square a parallelogram)

## rotation
A=1 0;0 1 how to rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise?
A=0 -1; 1 0 # realize that x axis (before 1 0) rotated 90 degrees to the left, so no it will ocupy y axis (0 1) and y axis now is -1 0

These transformations are useful for example in images where don't
forget that an image is just a matrix of pixels so we can play with images in with this transformations

We can apply a series of transformations to a vector, for example:
A2(A1r)
where A1= 0 1; -1 0 and A2= -1 0; 0 1 
A2A1=[-1 0; 0 1]*[0 1;-1 0]=0 -1; -1 0
The order of transformations matter, since it's not the same A2A1r and A1A2r
actually A1A2=0 1;1 0

matrices are associative but no conmutative

---------------------------------------------------------------------
##Solving an apple and bannanas problem
2a + 3b = 8
10a + 1 b = 13
where a= apples, and b= bannanas
and this could be presented as a matrix
[2 3;10 1][a;b]=[8;13]
Ar=s
A^-1A=I(identity matrix)
so 
(A^-1)Ar=(A^-1)s
so
(I)r=(A^-1)s
Now we will se how this idea of elimination helps us finding the inverse matrix.
(A^-1)A=I
for example:
A*B=I
#specific problem
A=[1 1 3; 1 2 4; 1 1 2]
r=[a;b;c]
s=[15;21;13]

so this would be the matrix
1st| 1 1 3 a   15
2nd| 1 2 4 b = 21
3rd| 1 1 2 c   13

I can take row one of row two

1st| 1 1  3  a   15
2nd| 0 1  1  b =  6
3rd| 0 0 -1  c   -2
#realize that -c = -2, so I can multiply only that row by -1 and  get that c=2
#this is called a triangular matrix because all below the leading diagonal is zero
#now we will perfom back substitution which means that I can take the value of C and put it in the first two rows

1st| 1 1 0 a   9
2nd| 0 1 0 b = 4
3rd| 0 0 1 c   2
#realize that now we have obtained the value of b
and again I can take that value and put in the first row

1st| 1 0 0 a   5
2nd| 0 1 0 b = 4
3rd| 0 0 1 c   2
#realize that we have found the identity matrix
the processes that we did were:
1. Elimination to get the triangular matrix
2. back substitution putting the number of c in the first rows and so on..
### I HAVE ONLY FOUND THE RESULT FOR THIS SPECIFIC VECTOR S
but how can I ind a general answer? (for any S)

----------------------------------------------------------------
##Going from Gaussian Elimination to finding the inverse matrix 

So to obtain the identity matrix we have to multiply our original matrix by the inverse matrix
(A^-1)A=I
AB=I, where A^-1=B
A=
1   1   3
1   2   4
1   1   2

B=
b11 b12 b13
b21 b22 b23
b31 b32 b33

I=
1   0    0
0   1    0
0   0    1

so for out matrix A, we can calculate the new matrix A`, which has the same entries as A, however the second row of A` is the second of row A minus the first row of A, and the third row of A` is the third row of A minus the first row of A
A`=
1  1  3
0  1  1 
0  0 -1
and I`=
 1  0  0
-1  1  0
-1  0  1
#realize we can multiply the third row by -1 since in A` we already have a triangular matrix
#we can Again perform the back substitution
A``=
1  1  0 #you are multiplying the third row by 3 to take the third  
0  1  0 #column =0 on the first row
0  0  1
and I``=
-2  0  3 ## remeber you took 3 times the third row off the 1st row
-2  1  1 # realize that despite of taking -1 on the 3rd column it
 1  0 -1 #is positive since -(-1)=1


FInally, now I take the second row from the first row
A```=
 1 0 0
 0 1 0
 0 0 1
I```=
 0 -1  2
-2  1  1
 1  0 -1

I have transformed A=A```=I
and I it has algo undergone some transformations to I``` which is equal to inverse matrix of A
I```= A^-1

This is one of the most computationally efficient way to find the inverse matrix in bigger datasets
