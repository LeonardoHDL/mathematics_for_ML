when refering to a vectors there two characteristics that
we can distinguish:
size and dot product. The size of a vector is the length
of the vector. The dot prodcut is also called the scalar
product. The dot product of two vectors is a scalar.
for example, a vector exists in a space that is not defined,
but we can do it by drawing to orthogonal lines.
and the the vector would be measured in any units we want.
and it will be the diagonal of the rectangle that is created
orthogonal space delimited by i,j and vector r= ai+bj.
and according to pitagoras theorem we can calculate the
length of the vector r.

the dot product is :
vector r = 3,2, so it has components ri and rj.
ri = 3 and rj = 2 
vector s = -1,2 has components si and sj.
si = -1 and sj = 2
And so the dot product would be:
r*s = ri*si + rj*sj = 3*(-1) + 2*2 = -3 + 4 = 1
so the dot product is a scalar.
dot product has some properties:
conmutative: r*s = s*r
distributive: r*(s+t) = r*s + r*t
and this allso applies if r,s,t are vectors too so it would 
be: r*(s+t) =r1*(s1+t1) + r2*(s2+t2) = r1*s1 + r1*t1 + r2*s2 + r2*t2 and so on...
other propertie is the associative propertie:
r*(s*t) = (r*s)*t where s is now an scalar.

### Cosine and dot product----------------
remember that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(theta)
the dot product is the same as the cosine of the angle between the vectors.
the dot product of orthogonal vectors is 0.
and if the vectors and in opposite directions the dot product is negative.
and if the vectors are in the same direction the dot product is positive.

facts about vectors:
--we can find the angle between two vectors by using the dot product.
--cos(theta) = r(dot)s / |r|*|s|(theta)
--the size of a vector is the square root of the dot product of the vector with itself.
--the vector projection of s onto r is equal to the 
scalar projection of s onto r times the unit vector in the direction of r.
--the vector projection is equal to the scalar projection times the unit vector in the direction of r.
unit vector is a vector that has a length of 1 and equals= vector/|vector|
--theta= r1 dot r2/|r1|*|r2|, if cos(theta) = 0 then theta = 90 degrees.


facts about dot product:
1. The dot product of two vectors is directly related to the cosine of the angle between them. 
Specifically, the dot product of two vectors A and B is equal to the product of their magnitudes 
(lengths) multiplied by the cosine of the angle theta between them. A Â· B = |A| * |B| * cos(theta)
This relationship allows us to determine the angle between two vectors using the dot product. 
2.helps us understand the relationship and orientation between the vectors.
3. The dot product of two vectors is a scalar value that represents the degree of 
similarity or correlation between the vectors.
 
###projection-------------------------


the projection of a vector r onto a vector s

a vector is defined in a space by the basis vectors i and j.
the vector r is defined by the components ri and rj.
but what if we had other basis vectors than i and j?
like u and w, then r would be defined by the components ru and rw.
we can know the components of r in u and w if we know the relationship between i,j and u,w.

to know the projection of r onto u,w space we need to know the components of r in u,w space.
we can use the scalar projection of r onto u space and then get the vector projection of r onto u space.
, and again repeat the process for w space.
this is "changing basis" or "change of basis".

#example:
we have a vector r = 5,-1 and we want to know the components of r in u,w space.
where u=1,1 and w=1,-1
length of vector u= sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
#but for some reason the professor is not taking the sqrt from the size of the vector so its just 2.
we need to know the scalar projection of r onto u and w.
scalar projection of r onto u = r dot u/|u| = 5*1 + (-1)*1 / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = 4/2
where the formula to get the scalar projection of r onto u is:
r dot u/|u|, where |u| refers to the length of the vector u.
scalar projection of r onto w = r dot w/|w| = 5*1 + (-1)*(-1) / sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = 6/2
unit vector of u = 1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)
unit vector of w = 1/sqrt(2),-1/sqrt(2)
formula to get unit vector = vector/|vector|, where |vector| refers to the length of the vector.
(obtained from the dot product of a vector with itself)
now we need to get the vector projection of r onto u and w.
vector projection of r onto u = scalar projection of r onto u * unit vector of u = 4/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2) = 2,2
vector projection of r onto w = scalar projection of r onto w * unit vector of w = 6/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2),-1/sqrt(2) = 3,-3
and now the components of r in u,w space are:
ru = 2 and rw = 3, these two values are obtained from both of the scalar projections of r onto u and w.
#example 2
r= 10,-5, u=3,4, and w= 4,-3
scalar projection of r onto u = r dot u/|u| = 10*3 + (-5)*4 / sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 10/25 = 10/25 = 2/5
scalar projection of r onto w = r dot w/|w| = 10*4 + (-5)*(-3) / sqrt(4^2 + (-3)^2) = 55/25 = 11/5
unit vector of u = 3/5,4/5
unit vector of w = 4/5,-3/5
components of r in u,w space are:
ruw=2/5,11/5
#example 3
r=2,2,u=-3,1,w=1,3
scalar projection of r onto u = r dot u/|u| = 2*(-3) + 2*1 / (-3)^2 + 1^2 = -4/10 = -2/5
scalar projection of r onto w = r dot w/|w| = 2*1 + 2*3 / 1^2 + 3^2 = 8/10 = 4/5
#example 4
r=1,1,1,u=2,1,0,w=1,-2,-1,z=-1,2,-5
scalar projection of r onto u = r dot u/|u| = 1*2 + 1*1 + 1*0 / 2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 = 3/5
scalar projection of r onto w = r dot w/|w| = 1*1 + 1*(-2) + 1*(-1) / 1^2 + (-2)^2 + (-1)^2 = -2/6 = -1/3
scalar projection of r onto z = r dot z/|z| = 1*(-1) + 1*2 + 1*(-5) / (-1)^2 + 2^2 + (-5)^2 = -4/30 = -2/15



###Basis, vector space and linear independence-----------------

a basis is a set of n vector which are linearly independent and span the space.
the space is n-dimensional
for example b1 and b2 span the space, but if we add b3, b3 is a linear independent vector
if we can not describe b3 in terms of any combination of b1 and b2.
b3 != a1b1 + a2b2
basis vector doesn't have to be orthogonal, but it's1 a lot easier
if they are.

###applications of changing basis-----------------
the goal of the learning from our neural network is gonna be to write 
a set of basis vectors that extract the most information from the data.
